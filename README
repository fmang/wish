Wish
====

Wish is a Perl library for looking up words and kanjis from a Japanese word and
kanji database. The current supported formats are KANJIDIC and EDICT2.

A command-line tool, `wdic`, is provided as a front-end.

Features
--------

Lots of dictionary tools exist, but have several issues, including being online
only, sorting results in an awkward way, or being too strict.

Wish search have the following features:

* Indifferent kana nature. Writing in hiragana or katakana is the same.
* Homophone lookup.
* Alternative kanjis or readings are grouped.
* Similar words also displayed. For example, 離す and 離れる.

Results are storted in a fashion meant for relevant words to appear first, but
it's not perfect.

Install
-------

### Unixy install

For the unfamiliar with Perl, the standard autotools procedure is
recommended:

	./configure --prefix=...
	make
	make install

### Perly install

A `Build.PL` file is also supplied for a standard CPAN install using
`Module::Build`:

	perl Build.PL --prefix=...
	./Build test
	./Build install

Use
---

### Initialization

Before Wish can be used, the word database needs to be built using
[KANJIDIC][kd] and [EDICT2][ed] files.

[kd]: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic.html
[ed]: http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/edict.html

You can download and load them like this:

	wget http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/kanjidic.gz
	gunzip kanjidic.gz
	wget http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/edict2.gz
	gunzip edict2.gz

	# Build the database, takes a little while
	wdic --load --kanjidic kanjidic --edict edict2

### Lookup

Lookup can be performed from the command-line, supplying lookup terms as
arguments, or as a REPL if `wdic` is called without arguments.

Check the man page for more information.
