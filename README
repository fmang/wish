Wish
====

Wish is a [Perl][p] tool for looking up words and kanjis from a Japanese word and
kanji database. The current supported formats are [KANJIDIC][kd] and [EDICT2][ed].

The command-line tool `wdic` is provided as a front end.

A web interface in also provided as a [FastCGI][fcgi] program, called `wish.fcgi`.

Features
--------

Lots of dictionary tools exist, but have several issues, including being online
only, sorting results in an awkward way, or being too strict.

Wish search have the following features:

* Indifferent kana nature. Writing in hiragana or katakana is the same.
* Homophone lookup.
* Alternative kanjis or readings are grouped.
* Similar words also displayed. For example, 離す and 離れる.

Results are storted in a fashion meant for relevant words to appear first, but
it's not perfect.

Dependencies
------------

To use the command-line tool, all you need is a standard [Perl][p] install.

To generated the man pages, `pod2man` from the Perl distribution is required.
Otherwise, the documentation is written at the top of the executables; don't be
shy.

If you want to use the web interface, you'll need Perl's `CGI` and `CGI::Fast`
modules. These are usually included in the standard distribution, but otherwise
they should be in your distributions repositories under the names `perl-cgi`
and `perl-cgi-fast`. Then a FastCGI spawner is required in order to start the
application. A popular choice is [spawn-fcgi][sf].

Install
-------

### Unixy install

For the unfamiliar with Perl, the standard autotools procedure is
recommended:

	./configure --prefix=...
	make
	make install

### Perly install

A `Build.PL` file is also supplied for a standard CPAN install using
`Module::Build`:

	perl Build.PL --prefix=...
	./Build test
	./Build install

Use
---

### Initialization

Before Wish can be used, the word database needs to be built using
[KANJIDIC][kd] and [EDICT2][ed] files.

You can download and load them like this:

	wget http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/kanjidic.gz
	gunzip kanjidic.gz
	wget http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/edict2.gz
	gunzip edict2.gz

	# Build the database, takes a little while
	wdic --load --kanjidic kanjidic --edict edict2

### Lookup

Lookup can be performed from the command-line, supplying lookup terms as
arguments, or in interactive mode if `wdic` is called without arguments.

Check the man page `wdic(1)` for more information.

### Web interface

`wish.fcgi` is just your standard FastCGI application.

In order to be pretty, the webserver's `/static` path should be redirected to,
usually `/usr/share/wish/static`.

Please refer to the man page `wish.fcgi(8)` for details.
